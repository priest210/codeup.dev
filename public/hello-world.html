		<h1> Hello from Codeup!</h1>

		<p>
			Focusing on a true passion and pursing a bucket list item by having the honor of being in the inaugural class to become a coder / programmer. This is something that has been at the top of my list to learn and venture into for a very long time, however I felt like I never had the time to pursue it due to its intensity and time required needed to truly grasp the concepts. Those that know me know that I like to immerse myself in anything I do and focus on becoming the best at it. Codeup is allowing me to do just that by providing the perfect environment to learn.

		</p>
		<p>

			Codedup is focused on turning non-techie people into programmers through an intensive 9-week immersive bootcamp that teaches Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP and Javascript.
		</p>

		<p>
			The most important thing about me that people should know is that I love helping people. Whether it is lending a hand to finish a project or helping them find solutions to their problems, it is a natural instinct of mine to help others.
		</p>
		<p>
			I love helping people and fixing problems and I am the first one in line to accept new challenges. You will not find anyone with more focus and desire to achieve organizational goals and operational improvement.
		</p> 

 

		<p>I love being inspired by people and I am working hard to be an inspiration to others. 
		</p>


		<p>Stay tuned in for updates.....</p>

		<h2>One of My Dream Vehicles</h2>

		<p>Growing up my Dad was a gear head.  That was his passion he would buy and rehab cars then he would sell them for a profit.  He had countless cars.  Too many to name.  I look back and think how great it would be to have some of the vehicles he owned back then. Mostly he stuck to domesic models.  I personally have grown fond of foreign vehicles especially those of the Italian variety.  Ferrari and Lamborghini!<br>
